## Brief Description + Requirements.
### Contract 2 - Ludovico Bitti
i am working on contract 2 which is Platformer Level Generator,my main objective is to make a map that will generate tile map
to represent a 2d side-scrolling platformer, so far my program creates a randomized map that uses perlin noise, the shapes are not squares. i will change the method of generating the map to achive the tile map.

### Contract 4 - David Brown 
I will be working on contract number 4 which is a Platformer Entity Reskinner, the main things that is required
for this program is to reskin different assets. The colour of these are to be changed. There are supposed to be four
qualities of which are represented by a set of colours. Each unit of this will be saved to a PNG file.

## Licensing.
Regarding Licensing, we will be using the MIT license as it is simple thus making it ideal for our project. The contracts
do not have overly specific license requirements, therefore having a simple license that covers the basics is ideal for
this project.
